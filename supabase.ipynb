All the \\ndocuments will be preserved electronically on hard disk. CD or tape. It was felt \\nappropriate and safe to maintain hard copies of the documents also till the CARD \\nsystem attains the desired degree of stability, Accordingly, in the Circular 38 dated', metadata={'source': 'RS_Total 2022.pdf', 'page': 323}), Document(page_content='22-1-99 at para 5 , specific instructions have been given to maintain the hard copies \\nof all the documents registered under the CARD project till 31-3-99. This period \\nwas subsequently extended up to 30-4-99 and then up to 30-6-99. The copies were \\nrequired to be taken using the laser printers in Cat A and Cat B offices and nearest A \\n& B office in respect of Cat C offices.\\n2) It has been observed that while in a majority offices, these copies of registered \\ndocuments are being maintained in the manner of filing volumes, they are being \\nmerely bundled and kept aside in some offices. In order to achieve uniformity in the \\nprocedure, the following instructions are issued for strict compliance by all the CARD \\nSub- Registrars.\\n3) The hard copies ( laser prints or dot-matrix printer copies) of all the documents shall \\nbe sequentially arranged accounting for completely, al the documents registered \\nunder the CARD system on and from 5-2-1999.

The DMP’s may be used when there is \\nno rush of documents on any day. In Category C offices, the prints shall be taken on \\nDMP’S. sufficient spares of print cartridges and DMP printer tapes shall be maintained \\nto ensure uninterrupted process.\\n5) The print outs on laser or DMP printer shall be taken as soon as the scanning is \\ncompleted, preferably before the document is returned to the party. In any case print \\nouts off all the documents scanned shall be taken invariably on the same day.\\n6) The copies of the documents shall then be authenticated on each page by the sub-', metadata={'source': 'RS_Total 2022.pdf', 'page': 324}), Document(page_content='registrar.
